# DevTown

Task: Create a responsive and interactive web page that displays a list of products. Each product should include an image, title, description, and price. Users should be able to filter and sort the products based on their attributes (e.g., price, category). Additionally, implement a user-friendly pagination system to navigate through the product list.

### Requirements:

- Use React.js for the front-end implementation.
- Utilise styled-components for styling the components.
- Ensure that the web page is visually appealing and responsive.
- Add smooth transitions or animations for user interactions.
- Implement filtering and sorting functionality for the products.
- Create a pagination system to display a reasonable number of products per page.
